This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.0. The project is a self service break tracking WordPress plugin originally written for a technical support call center. Although the project is a WordPress plugin, it uses MongoDB as the database backend for storing the actual break request data. The application is a hybrid port of a previous MEAN stack break tracking application. The plugin using Angular for the break request frontend and for the admin backend. The plugin uses WordPress's REST API with custom endpoints for handling data.
